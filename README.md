## Summary
A Person class with the following fields: name and age.
<br />
With the constructor and the necessary get and set methods must be created.
<br />
My own exception Incorrect Age that is thrown with the message 
<br /> 
"Age cannot be less than 1 nor greater than 110" in the method setAge of Person
<br /> 
when trying to set an age less than 1 or greater than 110.
<br />
My own exception BadName that is thrown with the message "The name must have at least 3 letters" <br />
in the setPersonName method when the name has less than 3 letters or contains a number respectively.
<br />
ManagePersons class that displays a menu to the user with the options:
<br />
1 - Add a person to an ArrayList of people
<br />
2 - Delete a person from an ArrayList of people.
<br />
0 - Exit
<br />
Program the different options of the previous menu, taking into account that:
<br />
The Add a person and delete a person options must be programmed in separate functions.
<br />
At most the ArrayList can contain 2 people, if you try to add a third throws, from the function of adding a person, an exception of the type TooObjects and catch it in the main.
<br />
When adding a person use setName and setAge to set the name and age. Capture the possible errors that they throw.
<br />
People are deleted based on the index within the ArrayList.
<br />
If the user indicates an index outside the possible range, it throws from the function to delete a person, an exception PositionIncorrecta and catches it in the main.
<br /> <br />
